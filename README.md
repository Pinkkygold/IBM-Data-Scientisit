‚úÖ **What this achieves:**

1. **Mini-dashboard effect** ‚Äì each chart gets a visual badge and clickable preview.  
2. **Portfolio-ready** ‚Äì recruiters can scroll and explore visuals **without opening files**.  
3. **Collapsible insights** ‚Äì keeps README neat and professional.  
4. **Interactive structure** ‚Äì easy to navigate, explore, and share.

If you want, I can **also create a version where each image preview shows a small animated GIF of the plot** (like a hover-over live view), which looks **very impressive for GitHub portfolios**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
